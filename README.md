# Publica

**Publica** is a structured and ongoing repository of AI Engineering learning and projects. The content is organized weekly and includes learning resources, tasks, and hands-on projects covering topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image recognition, Deployment and cloud computing.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by week:

publica:

  week_1:
  
    - learning/
    - tasks/
    - projects/
    
  week_2:
  
    - learning/
    - tasks/
    - projects/
    
  ...
  
  week_n:
  
    - learning/
    - tasks/
    - projects/

Each `week_x` folder contains:

- `learning/`: Study materials, notes, and reference content
- `tasks/`: Assignments or exercises based on the week's topics
- `projects/`: Practical mini-projects or implementations
