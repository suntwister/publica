# Publica

**Publica** is a structured and ongoing repository of AI Engineering learning and projects. The content is organized weekly and includes learning resources, tasks, and hands-on projects covering topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image recognition, Deployment and cloud computing.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by week:

publica/
