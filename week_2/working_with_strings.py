In the bustling heart of Lagos, there lived a weaver named Amara, known far and wide for her 
beautiful fabrics and sharp mind. Every morning, she sat by the lagoon’s edge, weaving 
vibrant cloths that told stories of her people: the shimmering waters, the flying fish, and 
the lively market scenes.
One day, the local chief announced a contest to find the cleverest person in the town. 
The prize was a golden loom said to weave the finest cloth in all of Nigeria. Many villagers 
rushed to participate, eager to win the prize.
When it was Amara’s turn, the chief asked her a question: “How can you turn a thread as thin 
as a hair into something stronger than steel?”
Amara smiled calmly and replied, “By weaving it together with others, just as a village grows
 stronger when its people work together.”
